# Project Description

## Introduction
The project focuses on predicting football team formations in matches based on historical player and match data. The main objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the formation of a winning team based on player statistics. This can provide valuable insights for football coaches and analysts, enabling them to make informed decisions about tactics and strategies.

## Project Objectives
1. Collect and clean historical football match data and player statistics.
2. Develop a machine learning model that can predict the formation of a winning team based on player statistics.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.
4. Provide insights into how player statistics affect formation and match outcomes.

## Materials and Methods Used
The project utilizes a variety of materials and methods, including:
- **Data Sources**: Data on football matches and player statistics are collected from multiple sources, including databases and CSV files.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data cleaning is performed to remove null values and incorrect formats, and relevant features are created for the model.
- **Machine Learning**: Machine learning models are developed using libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1 score are used to assess the model's performance.
- **Visualization**: Visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to graphically represent results and patterns.

## Results
The project has achieved the following results:
- Development of a machine learning model capable of predicting winning team formations in football matches with significant accuracy.
- Evaluation of the model showing its ability to accurately predict winning team formations.
- Insights into how player statistics influence formation and match outcomes, which can have practical applications in the football world and provide a strategic advantage to teams and coaches.

## Conclusions
The project demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning to predict winning team formations in football matches. The results show that player statistics are an important factor in determining formation and match outcomes. This approach can have practical applications in the world of football and provide a strategic advantage to teams and coaches.
